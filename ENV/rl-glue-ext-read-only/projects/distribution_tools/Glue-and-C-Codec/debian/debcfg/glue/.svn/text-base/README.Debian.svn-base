RL-Glue for Debian
-----------------

This Debian binary package provides a convenient and consistent
way for installing RL-Glue in Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives.
The package includes documentation and examples, the latter in
compressed tar.gz format. The documents are also registered in
the doc-base system, so that users can easily find them, using
any online documentation system available in Debian (eg. dhelp,
dwww or doc-central). For any Debian-specific issues, feel free
to contact the package maintainer via the e-mail address below.
