This is a 32-bit Windows binary package that does NOT require Cygwin to run.  No installation involved.  This does not help you if you want to write code using the C/C++ codec, but it will work for all other codecs.

It contains:
  * rl_glue.exe executable socket server
  * The documentation for RL-Glue (PDF)
  * A README.txt file with some hints on how to put rl_glue.exe into your path
