THIS DISTRIBUTION (BINARY)
----------------------------
This is a binary distribution, it contains rl_glue.exe, the technical manual (PDF), and the general overview (PDF).  This distribution will allow you to run RL-Glue 
experiments with codecs OTHER than C/C++.  To use agents, environments, and experiments written in C/C++ you will need to install the full RL-Glue Core package, which
requires Cygwin.

Tips
----------------------------
If you use this distribution, you can start rl_glue.exe a number of ways. You can just double-click 
it, for example. This will probably be very tedious in the long run.

You should probably put rl_glue.exe into your $PATH, so that you can easily find it either from 
the Windows COMMAND program, or from within other programs like Matlab. 

By default, the  Windows/System folder is in the path, so if you put rl_glue.exe in that folder, you will be able to 
start it easily. If you put it elsewhere you should consider updating your Windows path to include 
it.

There are instructions on the Internet that can help you with this, for example:

Once rl_glue.exe is in your $PATH, you can start it from the windows COMMAND program by typing: 
C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1>rl_glue.exe
