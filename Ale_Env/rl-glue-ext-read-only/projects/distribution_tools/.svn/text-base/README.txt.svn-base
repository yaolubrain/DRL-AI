This directory is full of tools meant for the core group of developers to release updates to RL-Glue and Codecs.

Don't screw around in here unless you have business to do, please.  You can break lots of things.

To set these scripts up so they will work for you.

a) Create a file in this directory called "svn-password".  The password should have a single line (no line break at the end) and should just be:
svnusername svnpassword

The username is your google code account name, and your google code password.

b)  Check out https://rl-glue-ext.googlecode.com/svn/wiki to this directory, like:
svn co https://rl-glue-ext.googlecode.com/svn/wiki wiki

This is required because the different distribution scripts need to update parts of the wiki.

That's it!  Good luck.
