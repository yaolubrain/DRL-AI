#summary This page contains links and information about all of the current Java Codec downloads for RL-Glue.

*Notes:* To use this or any other codec, you must have RL-Glue Core installed first.

=== Available Downloads (only one is required)===

 * [JAVA-USER-LINK Java User Distribution JAVA-USER-VERSION] [JAVA-USER-DETAILS-LINK (File Details)]
 The *user* distribution is no-nonsense distribution that most people will want to download.
 It contains:
   * Java codec compiled into a JAR file (with installer)
   * The documentation (PDF)
   * The examples
   * README file to get you started if you don't like manuals

 * [JAVA-DEV-LINK Java Developer Distribution JAVA-DEV-VERSION] [JAVA-DEV-DETAILS-LINK (File Details)]
 The *dev* distribution is almost a snapshot of the development directory of this project.  It includes all of the source code, the ant compile scripts, tests, javadocs, tests, etc.


These are both platform-independent RL-Glue codecs written in Java.  Java 1.5 or higher is required to use them.  Both distributions include a pre-compiled JAR file that has all of the Java classes already built and packaged.  There is also an automated installer program to add the RL-Glue classes as a system extension so they can be used easily by your programs.  It should install on most Linux and Unix platforms, including Mac OS X and on Microsoft Windows.
